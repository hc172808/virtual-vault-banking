Instructions to Use

Replace the placeholder passwords:

POSTGRES_PASSWORD in postgres

PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD in pgadmin

with the secure passwords generated by your installer, or generate new ones.

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:

/opt/virtual-vault-banking/
│
├─ dbdata/              # PostgreSQL persistent volume
├─ prometheus/
│   └─ prometheus.yml   # Prometheus config file
├─ docker-compose.yml
└─ .env


Start all services:

docker-compose up -d


Check logs:

docker-compose logs -f


Stop all services:

docker-compose down

Optional: Auto-backup & network

Your installer already created a backup script vault-backup.

All Docker services are on vault-network, which matches the .env database connection.

✅ Your hybrid setup is now fully redeployable

Node.js app runs via systemd

PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Prometheus, Grafana run via Docker

Firewall, Fail2ban, HTTPS handled on host

Self-contained, easy to backup & restore

Can be redeployed on any new server in 1 command:

docker-compose up -d
